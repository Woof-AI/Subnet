#  Introduction

“WOOF” is the expression of a dog’s bark. We are developing an AI project designed to analyze and mimic canine behavior. By collecting dog barks uploaded by users, we aim to build a large-scale model to analyze dogs emotions and predict their behaviors, fostering a closer emotional bond between humans and dogs. We hope to encourage people around the world to form deeper connections with dogs. In the future, we look forward to expanding Woof AI's capabilities to provide more personalized interactions, enhance pet care, and revolutionize how we communicate with our furry companions. Woof woof!

# Notice
The model always stays on your machine and is yours!
The data provided by our community friends and the benefits and efficiency brought by running in the subnet will better help us train the dog model

# About US

WOOFAI, a pioneering project within the Bittensor ecosystem ($TAO), revolutionizes decentralized AI by focusing on dog behaviors. This DeAI model trains digital AI dogs for Web3.0, utilizing Bittensor’s robust infrastructure to enhance AI applications that interact with canine behaviors innovatively.
1. Decentralized AI (De-AI): WOOFAI is driven by an innovative token economy, powering its DeAI framework.
2. Integration with Meme Culture:The $DOGE of Bittensor ecosystem, ignites $TAO value with its MEME culture.
3. Built on the Bittensor Ecosystem: Bittensor is the next-generation AI blockchain network, Co-incubated by prominent institutions such as DCG along with leading global exchanges like Binance, indicating significant backing from key players in the industry.
4. Subnet Development and Testing: With the help of Bittensor officials and the community, WOOFAI is now in the testnet phase, testing our DeAI economic model and building early data with user participation.
